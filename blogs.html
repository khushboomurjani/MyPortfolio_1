          <h1>Netflix: The Future of Entertainment or House of Cards?</h1>
          <small>December, 2022</small>
          <p>
            For better or worse, Netflix has changed not just the entertainment business, but also the way that we (the audience) watch television. 
            In the process, it has also enriched its investors, as its market capitalization climbed to $139 billion in March 2018 and even after the market correction for the FANG stocks, 
            its value is substantial enough to make it one of the largest entertainment company in the world. Among the FANG stocks, with their gigantic market capitalizations, 
            it remains the smallest company on both market value and operating metrics, but it has almost as big an impact on our daily lives as its larger peers.

          <h1>Dual coding - how can it be used in Languages</h1>
          <small>December, 2022</small>
          <p>
            We - teachers spend a lot of our time planning and designing engaging resources for our students. 
            However, the question I will pose is: 'What is the purpose of these resources?' The foremost purpose for them 
            is to be a teaching tool which should enable students to understand, process and remember the information/knowledge at hand clearly and easily.
